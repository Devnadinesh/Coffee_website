    <p id="p2">
       A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily.Exceptions include possible increased risk in pregnant womenof fetal loss or decreased birth weight.Results were complicated by poor study quality,nand differences in age, gender, health status and serving size.

    <h2>TYPES</h2>

    <p id="p3">Coffee beans are seeds of a fruit called coffee cherry.Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea.There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants,ranging from shrubs to trees.

        <ul>
            <li> 
                <b>Type of bean:</b>
                There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta.Arabica originates from Ethiopia.The main differences between them are their taste and where they are grown. When it comes to their difference in caffeine level, Robusta beans contain twice the level of caffeine than Arabica beans. Arabica beans have a milder, more aromatic taste while Robusta beans hold a stronger, more acquired flavor.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                <b>Type of roast:</b>
                Coffee roasts can be categorized into four main types based on the degree of roasting, each offering a distinct flavor profile. Light roasts, with temperatures between 356°F and 401°F, are light brown and have bright, acidic, and complex flavors, often with fruity or floral notes. Medium roasts, ranging from 410°F to 428°F, are medium brown and provide a balanced mix of acidity and body with a hint of sweetness. Dark roasts, with temperatures from 464°F to 482°F, are dark brown to almost black, with a bold, smoky, and robust flavor, pronounced bitterness, and less acidity.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                <b>Type of grind</b>
                Coffee grinds can be categorized into several types based on coarseness, each suited for different brewing methods. Extra coarse grind, resembling peppercorns, is used for cold brew, while coarse grind, like sea salt, is ideal for French press. Medium grind, similar to sand, suits drip coffee makers, and fine grind, like sugar, is perfect for espresso machines. Extra fine grind, almost powdery, is used for Turkish coffee.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                <b>Decaffeinated Coffee</b>
                Decaffeinated coffee, or decaf, is coffee with most of the caffeine removed, usually through water soaking and extraction methods. It retains much of the flavor and aroma of regular coffee but with significantly less caffeine. This makes it a suitable option for those wanting to reduce their caffeine intake. A small amount of caffeine typically remains in decaf coffee.
